Today, I have added a few new private frontends to R4fo.com. These include:
- [Safetwitch](https://safetwitch.r4fo.com) (Twitch)
- [LibremDB](https://libremdb.r4fo.com) (IMDb)
- [Quetre](https://quetre.r4fo.com) (Quora)
- [Scribe](https://scribe.r4fo.com) (Medium)
- [Rimgo](https://rimgo.r4fo.com) (Imgur)
- [*Breezewiki](https://breezewiki.r4fo.com) (Fandom)

These are even more services that you can use privately without any 📢 ads, 👁️ tracking or ☝️fingerprinting! <br>

*\*Please note that on the BreezeWiki instance, there are some direct connections to Fandom.com*
