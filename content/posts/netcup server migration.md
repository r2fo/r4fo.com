Our Oracle server, with its 10TB bandwidth, used to suffice for hosting private frontends. But as our Piped user count grew, so did our bandwidth needs.

Luckily I found Netcup's rootserver to fit my needs. It has 120TB of bandwidth per month, which is more than enough for the Piped instance (which is expected to use around 20TB per month). In a few days, I will setup a Tor relay to donate the rest of the bandwidth to a good cause. All other services will continue to run on the Oracle server, only the Piped instance will be migrated.

Of course, these upgrades cost money and I would really appreciate it if you could donate. I have recently improved the donation system and switched to Ko-Fi, we have one-time payments now and a variety of payment options. You could also support me by using my Netcup coupon codes, you get a discount and I get a small commission.

Our Piped user base is growing fast, and we were on the edge of the bandwidth limit (10TB) of the Oracle server. I stumbled on Netcup's rootserver and with a substantial 120TB bandwidth, it is more than enough for our 20TB monthly usage. Past friday, I migrated Piped to the Netcup server, all other services will continue to run on the Oracle server in Amsterdam.

Also, to make a positive impact, I'll be donating the excess bandwidth to the Tor Project, by running a Tor relay.

As a last note, your support matters. Please consider supporting us via our improved donation system or by using our Netcup coupon codes, you will get a huge discount and I will earn a little commission. Your donations directly impact service quality and potential upgrades in the future.
