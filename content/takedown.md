## Please read this carefully before requesting any takedowns

All the services that I run are so-called proxies. They **do not** host any content, they [proxy](https://wikiless.r4fo.com/wiki/Proxy_server) content that is hosted on the corresponding platform.
If you want to takedown content, then send your request to the original platform. After they remove the content, it is automatically gone from my services.

If you still want to contact me, send an email to abuse@r4fo.com <br>
‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that submitting incorrect takedown requests is illegal and may result in legal consequences.

My servers are run in Europe and are protected by European law:
