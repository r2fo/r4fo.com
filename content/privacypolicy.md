## Data collected by the Operator
### This website (r4fo.com)
- Hosted by Cloudflare Pages, to ensure uptime in case of server maintenance.
- I do not collect any data, but Cloudflare probably does

### Nginx

- By default, all access and error logs in Nginx are sent to <code><a href="https://wikiless.r4fo.com/wiki/Null_device">/dev/null</a></code>.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Logging may temporarily be enabled to combat abuse or to debug errors. These logs contain your IP address, user agent, query and timestamp. These logs will be erased almost immediately (within 1-3 hours). I will inform you about any logging through the below text. 
- Currently logging is **‚ùå DISABLED** (for a history you can view the [changelog](#changelog) below)
- üîÑ Cloudflare Proxy is **‚úÖ ENABLED**, unless otherwise noted

### Piped (piped.r4fo.com)
- I only collect the following essential data if you have create an account: username, password (<a href="https://wikiless.r4fo.com/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#:~:text=A%20common%20use%20of%20hashes,in%20a%20file%20or%20database">hashed</a>) and channel subscriptions.
- I do not view the database, but you have to trust me on my word

- <strong style="color: orange;">Cloudflare</strong> is used for <strong style="color: hsl(210, 92%, 56%);">CDN and security</strong>. Cloudflare may log traffic that looks suspicious, normal users do not have to worry since only bots and abusers fall into this. These WAF logs include: IP Address, User Agent and Query. Cloudflare discards these WAF logs after 14 days. [Their privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)
- <strong style="color: hsl(270, 60%, 70%);">Crowdsec</strong> is used for <strong style="color: hsl(210, 92%, 56%);">security</strong>. Crowdsec is open source and runs locally.
